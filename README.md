# ComfyUI Camera Angle Selector

A ComfyUI custom node that provides an interactive 3D interface for selecting camera angles for the FAL multi angle lora [https://huggingface.co/fal/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Multiple-Angles-LoRA] for QWen Edit. Select from 96 different camera angle combinations (8 view directions × 4 height angles × 3 shot sizes) with visual feedback and multi-selection support.

### View Directions (8 angles)
- Front view
- Front-right quarter view
- Right side view
- Back-right quarter view
- Back view
- Back-left quarter view
- Left side view
- Front-left quarter view

### Height Angles (4 types)
- Low-angle shot
- Eye-level shot
- Elevated shot
- High-angle shot

### Shot Sizes (3 types)
- Close-up

**Total: 96 unique camera angle combinations**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- ComfyUI installed and running
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Navigate to ComfyUI's custom_nodes directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   ```

2. **Clone or copy this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> ComfyUI_CameraAngleSelector
   ```
   
   Or if you have the files locally:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/ComfyUI_CameraAngleSelector .
   ```

3. **Restart ComfyUI** to load the new node.

## Usage

### In ComfyUI

1. **Add the Node:**
   - Right-click in the node editor
   - Search for "Camera Angle Selector"
   - Add the node to your workflow

2. **Select Camera Angles:**
   - Click on the 3D visualization to open the full interface
   - Click on camera icons to select/deselect angles
   - Drag the scene to rotate the view
   - Use filters to narrow down visible cameras
   - Use "Select Visible" to select all currently filtered cameras
   - Use "Clear All" to deselect all cameras

3. **Connect the Output:**
   - Connect the `selected_angles` output to any node that accepts string inputs
   - The output is a list of strings, one per selected camera angle

### Output Format

Each selected camera angle is returned as a formatted string:

```
<sks> {view_direction} {height_angle} {shot_size}
```

**Example outputs:**
```
<sks> front view low-angle shot close-up
<sks> front-right quarter view eye-level shot medium shot
<sks> back view high-angle shot wide shot
```

## Node Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `selected_indices` | STRING | Internal parameter (auto-managed by the 3D interface) |

## Node Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `selected_angles` | STRING (List) | List of selected camera angle prompt strings |

## Interface Controls

### 3D View
- **Click** on a camera to select/deselect it

## Technical Details

### Python Node
- Uses `OUTPUT_IS_LIST = (True,)` to enable list output
- Returns `("STRING",)` as `RETURN_TYPES`
- Handles JSON input from the frontend interface

### Frontend
- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Uses raycasting for click detection on 3D objects
- Implements drag-to-rotate camera controls
- PostMessage API for ComfyUI integration

## Troubleshooting

### Node not appearing in ComfyUI
- Ensure the folder is in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
- Restart ComfyUI after installation
- Check for errors in the ComfyUI console

### 3D interface not loading
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure Three.js CDN is accessible
- Try refreshing the page

### Selections not persisting
- Make sure you're clicking directly on camera icons
- Check that the node is properly connected in the workflow
